# FRorpus demo version

FRorpus is a corpus interface developed in Freiburg Research Group in Saami Studies. It works directly with R package [FRelan](github.com/izvakomi/FRelan), which which parses the ELAN files into format that is suitable for corpus searches.

The most relevant aspect of FRorpus is the ease of integrating metadata into the searches. The data frame produced by FRelans `read_eaf()` function contains both the session name and the speaker id. These can be associated with any relevant combinations of metadata.

In this demo the token data is real, but the metadata is generated in the `helper_function.R script`.
